# Terminal Hunt



For me, this task was a lot of fun, because the instructions were so clear that anyone could understand them. As well, I've been interested in quizzes since childhood, so it made it even more enjoyable. The commands were pretty easy to understand after watching a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apGV9Kg7ics) about git and github.
