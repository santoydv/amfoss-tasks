## My views about the tasks
Few of the tasks were easy, some were average, and a few were very difficult. In my experience, flutter one was really difficult for me, and CS50 proved to be very helpful. As a result of these diverse tasks, I was able to learn many things and also developed an aptitude for self-learning. As a whole, the tasks are good and one will learn a lot after completing them.

## My Introduction
Hello Seniors, I am Santosh Yadav from Simara Nepal. I came to know about amfoss while doing research about all the campuses of Amrita University. While I was offered Banglore Campus, I chose Amritapuri Campus because of Amfoss, despite it being too far from my country. If I am accepted, I hope Amfoss will provide me with the opportunity to learn many things and to be guided through my goal. Although I only know C programming and have learned Python while doing these tasks, I have a strong desire to learn more and more technologies. It is my goal to be better than I was yesterday and to learn every day, and I am very optimistic that Amfoss will assist me in this endeavor.
