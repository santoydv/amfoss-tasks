## Programming

ince I learned C programming after 12th grade, I attempted all the questions using only C. Honestly, these questions were so challenging. I could not answer them all using C so I learned Python from an [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&t=5766s) and answered some questions using Python also.
