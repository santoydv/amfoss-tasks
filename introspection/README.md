## INTROSPECTION

## Why must we choose you?

Having grown up in a small village of Nepal, technologies were not that familiar to me during my childhood, but since I became familiar with technologies and computers, my interest has only grown. Coding and solving problems using technologies give me the most joy, and I am also passionate about learning new technologies. It never gets boring for me to learn about new technologies and I strive to use them for the benefit of mankind. Since amfoss works on many diversified projects and also offers open source training, I think amfoss will be the best place for me to explore and learn more things I'm really passionate about. I am also passionate about taking on challenges and working hard for them when it comes to computer science related stuffs.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?

During the next few months, I want to explore some new fields such as Android development, Blockchain development, etc., and enhance my coding skills. Blockchain development has always fascinated me from the moment I heard about decentralization, cryptocurrency, and its applications. Therefore, I will try to learn as much as I can about it while also concentrating on academics since our scholarship will be revoked if we don't get a certain CGPA .

## How would you contribute back to the club?

I love challenges and work hard for them to my full potential, so I can contribute to many of amfoss's projects once I get into it. In addition, I'm pretty good at working in groups so I'm sure I'll be able to contribute if I'm accepted into Amfoss.

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
When I watched  all the tasks for the first time, I had thought there's no way I could complete these all tasks but when i kept on doing I found it easier than I thought. I think amfoss' selection process is excellent, even if one doesn't get into it, they will end up learning many things if they have attempted and tried doing these tasks. I found the selection process amazing because the tasks actually push us to our limits and teach us a lot.
