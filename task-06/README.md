## Flame game

Among all the tasks, this one was the hardest for me. The installation of Flutter, Androidstudio, and managing the setups is a challenge in itself. Although I learned the basics of flutter from YouTube, I still had a lot of difficulty doing this. Finally with the help of [this article](https://blog.codemagic.io/flutter-flame-game-development/), I was able to complete this task.
