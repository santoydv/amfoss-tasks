## CS50

It was easy for me to understand the concepts again since I had already watched a few of the CS50 videos. I wasn't able to watch all the videos, but I managed to do problem sets till 4 since I knew C. This course has been very helpful for me to learn the basics of computer science, and the teacher is also very good.  I will certainly watch the remaining videos during this holiday and try to do all the problem sets.
