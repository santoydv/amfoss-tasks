## Krypto Scrapper

The resources provided were more than enough for me to complete this task. Also, I found one article from [Oxylab](https://oxylabs.io/blog/rust-web-scraping) helpful while doing this work. Finding the first four selectors was easy, but the last one was tricky. I learned a little bit about sibling selectors and was able to make it work.
